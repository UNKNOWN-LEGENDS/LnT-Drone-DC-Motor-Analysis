# Project Details
This repository contains a small project on `Modeling and Analysis of a DC Motor for Drone Applications` for the course `Drone Technology and its Transformative Applications` through `CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore`.

This project was completed by Maria Deepti (2360413), Dominic Andrew P. (2360365), P. G. Sravani (2360429) and Krishjeet Brar (2360403) for the academic year 2025-2026, 5th Semester students. This project focuses on how the Speed-Torque relation for the DC motor on a drone is established and the effect of varying supply voltage on motor RPM. This repository contains a report for the project which was submitted as our assignment to the course.
